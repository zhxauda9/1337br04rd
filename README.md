## 👽 What is 1337b04rd?

**1337b04rd** is not just a regular imageboard — it’s a portal into chaotic dimensions.  
Designed with a _blackhole aesthetic_ 🖤🕳 and radioactive green 💚 glow, it’s a tribute to everything wild, weird, and wicked in the multiverse.  
**Built by degenerates for degenerates**, it allows interdimensional lifeforms to post anonymously, scream into the void, and leave their mark in threads that decay like unstable antimatter.

_You don’t register. You don’t ask. You post and disappear..._  
Because in the multiverse, **identity is for cowards**.

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🧊 **Anonymous Posting** — Be anyone. Be no one. Be a Meeseeks.
- 🧪 **Self-Destructing Threads** — After ~10-15 minutes, posts decay like bad science experiments.
- 👽 **Dynamic Avatars** — Get a face from another universe. No two alike.
- 🌐 **Quote Replies** — Use post IDs to reference your fellow travelers.
- 🛰️ **Sci-fi UI** — Dark UI, CRT-style glow, green-acid highlights. Looks illegal. Probably is.
- 🧹 **The Archive Zone** — Deleted threads don’t die; they phase into the archive dimension.
- 🔐 **Session Cookies** — Persistent identities without registration. Who needs OAuth when you have chaos?

## 📡 Learning Objectives

- 🧱 Mastery of **Hexagonal Architecture** with Go
- 🌠 Deep API integration (Rick and Morty API)
- 🧊 Handling **sessions, tokens, and identity** like a real dimensional smuggler
- 🧪 Testing and structured logging in production-grade apps
- 🎨 Creating a **thematic frontend** that feels alive and pulsing with portal energy

## 🛸 Future Plans

- 🌀 **Darknet Mode** — Switch to a more chaotic UI variant for ~true~ interdimensional degenerates
- 🧠 **AI-generated posts** — Let Ricks from other dimensions auto-respond to your threads
- 🎮 **Mini-games** — Interact with threads by solving puzzles from other timelines
- 🪞 **Mirror Dimensions** — Fork threads into parallel timelines

## 🧪 Final Thoughts

> _"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!"_ means "**I am in great pain, please post memes**."

Welcome to **1337b04rd**. You're not supposed to be here, but neither is sanity.  
_This isn't Reddit. This isn't 4chan. This is the black void between them._
